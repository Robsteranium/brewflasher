## Privacy Policy

BrewFlasher does not explicitly collect or transmit any user information or usage statistics.

BrewFlasher accesses [fermentrack.com](http://www.fermentrack.com) to download a list of
available firmware, as well as other websites to download the firmware itself. These 
websites - like all websites - may keep logs of access history which could include 
(amongst other things) the IP address from which the request was made.

Although the author of BrewFlasher does not use this access information for any marketing
purposes, it is possible that the websites serving individual firmware files might. Using
BrewFlasher requires that you understand and accept this risk.
