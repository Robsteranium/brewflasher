## Privacy Policy

BrewFlasher does not explicitly collect or transmit any user information.

BrewFlasher accesses [brewflasher.com](http://www.brewflasher.com) to download a list of
available firmware, as well as other websites to download the firmware itself. These 
websites - like all websites - may keep logs of access history which could include 
(amongst other things) the IP address from which the request was made. BrewFlasher.com
does anonymously log when a specific firmware item is selected to be flashed for the
purposes of tracking the popularity of various projects.

Although BrewFlasher.com provides BrewFlasher with links to the firmware to be flashed, 
neither BrewFlasher or BrewFlasher.com actually provide the firmware itself. Firmware is 
downloaded directly from the sites on which it is hosted. The privacy policies of these
websites may - and likely do - differ from this privacy policy, and may log additional
information beyond what this policy specifies. This is outside BrewFlasher's control. 
Using BrewFlasher requires that you understand and accept this risk.
